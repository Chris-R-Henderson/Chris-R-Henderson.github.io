<p>Pubworks is a preliminary rocket engine design that produces 10,000N of thrust and utilizes regenerative cooling to satisfy the main customer requirement of reusability. Due to it’s small size, we’ve decided to 3D print our engine using inconel 718, which possesses the required thermal and structural properties to maintain structural integrity. Furthermore, a pintle injector was selected for its reusability, combustion stability and its ease of manufacture. Our initial O/F ratio and chamber pressure was selected so as to maintain a reasonable chamber temperature. From there, lateral cooling channels were selected instead of concentric channels due to its increased heat transfer efficiency as it allows more surface area of the thrust chamber to be cooled during operations.<p>
          <div>
	<p>At this stage in development we have obtained sufficient cooling of the thrust chamber to below the melting point of inconel 718 with a factor of safety of 1.4. Through heat transfer analysis of the engine we have obtained gas side wall temperature, coolant temperature, and heat flux as a function of the distance from the injector plate. Pressure and temperature of the coolant has also been determined at all locations through the thrust chamber. This ensures that the coolant does not boil before it enters the injector. Furthermore, we have designed a test stand that is capable of mounting the engine for static fire. A propulsion system has yet to be designed and will need to be addressed in the next phase of design. I would like to acknowledge Brandon Sheehan, Alexia Louis, and Eric Aguilar for the controbutions to this project. This continues to be a large undertaking and would not be possible by myself.
